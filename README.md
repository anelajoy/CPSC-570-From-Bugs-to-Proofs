This is the repository for the course CPSC-570 From Bugs to Proof in Spring 2026.

At the end of the course, we will have written a draft of an introductory book on the use of software tools and formal reasoning to develop programs that are correct by construction.

In this course, we will learn how to write programs that are correct by construction. According to the slogan "one proof to replace 1000 test cases" this will demonstrate practical applications of logical reasoning and formal methods to concrete problems in software engineering, ranging from small individual to industry-grade projects, and supported by cutting-edge AI tools. We will use functional programming and type theory to guarantee the safety and reliability of code, based on the viewpoint that mathematical and logical proofs correspond to executable programs.

Possible languages used in this course are, for example, Python, Haskell, Lean, Dafny or others.

## Assessment

Assessment will be divided into a total of 200 points:

| Component               | Points |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Homework                 | 100           |    
| Book chapter |100       |                        |
| **TOTAL**               | **200**|                     

There are are 12 homework à 12 points. The total points for the homework is capped at a 100.

You can also substitute up to two homework assignments by a presentation (approx. 15 mins) on an interesting case study (especially from industry or academic research) that involves tools or theories that we are discussing, or related ones. For scheduling purposes, please let me know a week in advance (or earlier) if you are planning to give a presentation. I am happy to help with planning and walking you through while preparing the presentation.

Instructions and guidelines for the book chapter will be released separately shortly.

## Course Grade Breakdown

Grading scale used for the course:

| Percentage | Letter |
|---|---|
| 90 |	A |
| 80-89 | 	B |
| 70-79	| C |
| 60-69	| D |
| < 60 |	F |

You must score a 70 or above to receive a P when taking the course P/NP.

## Late Policy

It is important to start working on any assignment before the deadline. For example, in case you have questions, there needs to be time to aske them in office hours. On the other hand, I want you to do good work and I am happy to give you more time if that improves the quality of your work. Here are the rules I came up with:

- If midnight approaches and you need a bit more time to finish that is not a problem as long as you submit before the sun rises.

- If you need more time than that you need to be able to convince me that you started early and already have done substantial work (for example by showing me the code in your GitHub repository). You need to send me an email explaining the special circumstances at least one day before the deadline.

I reserve the right to not grade any work that does not follow this policy.

## Jupyter Book

The course book lives in the [`book/`](book/) directory. It uses **Jupyter Book 2** ([MyST](https://mystmd.org/)), which reads [`book/myst.yml`](book/myst.yml) and the legacy v1 table of contents in [`book/_toc.yml`](book/_toc.yml). The chapter tree matches [`book/book-chapters.md`](book/book-chapters.md); contributor roles are in [`book/book-chapter-assignments.md`](book/book-chapter-assignments.md).

For orientation, cf. the book from [CPSC-510](https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing/content/02-logic-programming-prolog.html). The expected length per chapter is 5-10 pages when printed out.

## Timeline

* First draft due: May 15
* My feedback to you: May 20
* Final version due: May 25

### Setup, installation, etc.

**Quick setup** (recommended): creates `book/.venv`, installs the `jupyter-book` CLI (bundles a compatible Node toolchain via `nodeenv`), and builds static HTML to `book/_build/html/`.

```bash
./setup-book.sh
```

This runs [`book/setup.sh`](book/setup.sh) then `jupyter-book build --html` inside `book/`. For **install only**, use `cd book && ./setup.sh` and build later yourself.

**Preview the built site:** After `./setup-book.sh`, run **[`./serve-book.sh`](serve-book.sh)** from the repository root and open **http://localhost:8844/** (leave that terminal open). **`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`** means nothing is listening on that port yet—start `./serve-book.sh` first, or you stopped the server while the tab was still trying to load.

**`BASE_URL` and static files:** MyST emits asset links like `/build/...`. Opening `book/_build/html/index.html` with **`file://`** usually fails (you may see a “BASE_URL” warning). For **GitHub project Pages** at `https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-570-From-Bugs-to-Proofs/`, build with the repo path as base URL, for example **`BASE_URL=/CPSC-570-From-Bugs-to-Proofs ./setup-book.sh`** or run [`book/scripts/build-github-pages.sh`](book/scripts/build-github-pages.sh) before uploading HTML.

**Student workflow** (install, build static HTML, and print Git steps for pushing chapter work):

```bash
./book/scripts/student-book-setup.sh
```

The same script is available as [`./scripts/student-book-setup.sh`](scripts/student-book-setup.sh) from the repository root.

**Manual setup**:

1. **Install and build** from the repository root:

   ```bash
   ./setup-book.sh
   ```

   Or install dependencies only, then build in a second step:

   ```bash
   cd book
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   jupyter-book build --html
   ```

2. **Rebuild** (after editing sources; from `book/` with the venv activated):

   ```bash
   cd book
   source .venv/bin/activate
   jupyter-book build --html
   ```

3. **View the book locally** (do not use `file://` on `index.html`; see note above):

   ```bash
   ./serve-book.sh
   ```

   Then open **http://localhost:8844/** and keep the server running.

   Alternatively, from `book/` with `.venv` active:

   ```bash
   cd book
   source .venv/bin/activate
   jupyter-book start
   ```

   Use the URL printed in the terminal (often a high port, not 8844).

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** (pick one approach):

   **A. GitHub Actions (recommended)** — On GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**. Then merge or push to **`main`**; the workflow [`.github/workflows/deploy-book.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-book.yml) builds with `BASE_URL=/CPSC-570-From-Bugs-to-Proofs` and publishes the site. You can also run it manually under **Actions → Deploy book to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**.

   **B. Manual from your laptop** — With `ghp-import` installed (`pip install ghp-import` or use `book/.venv`):

   ```bash
   ./deploy-book.sh
   ```

   That rebuilds for Pages and pushes the **`gh-pages`** branch. In GitHub **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch** and set the branch to **`gh-pages`** (not Actions). Do not mix branch-based deploy and the Actions workflow unless you intend to maintain both.

5. **View the book** (after the first successful deploy): `https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-570-From-Bugs-to-Proofs/`

**Development**:

- Chapter sources live under `book/content/` as MyST Markdown (`.md`). You can add `.ipynb` notebooks there as well; see the [MyST notebooks guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/notebooks-with-markdown).
- Optional interactive examples (if present): [Z3 Examples](z3/z3-examples.ipynb)
