Author: Kaye Galang · Reviewer: Anela Quiroz  
See [Chapter assignments](0-chapter-assignments.md).
```

This chapter introduces **Haskell** with emphasis on types that track effects
(for example monads and `IO`) and equational reasoning. We will see how
Haskell's strict separation between pure and effectful code is not merely a
stylistic choice — it is what makes large-scale equational reasoning and
machine-assisted verification practical.

## Goals

- Relate pure functional programming to verification.
- Use a concise example to illustrate effects and monads.
- Explore the `Maybe` and `Either` monads as a further aspect.
- Link to GHC documentation, *Learn You a Haskell*, and modern Haskell tooling.

## 1  Pure Functions and Equational Reasoning

A **pure function** has two properties:

1. Its output depends only on its inputs — no hidden state, no globals.
2. It has no **side effects**: it does not read from a file, print to the
   terminal, modify a mutable variable, or throw an exception that alters
   program state.

In mathematics, you can freely substitute equals for equals:
if $f(x) = x + 1$ and $x = 3$, then $f(x) = f(3) = 4$.
This is called **equational reasoning** and it is completely safe because
$f$ does nothing except compute a value.

In an imperative language this substitution is *not* always safe:

```python
# Python — side-effecting function; substitution can break meaning
count = 0
def increment():
    global count
    count += 1
    return count

x = increment()   # x = 1, count = 1
y = increment()   # y = 2, count = 2
# x ≠ y even though both are "increment()"
```

Haskell makes purity the *default*. Every top-level definition in Haskell
is a pure expression unless its type explicitly says otherwise. This
default unlocks three verification superpowers:

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Referential transparency** | Any sub-expression may be replaced by its value without changing program meaning. |
| **Equational proofs** | You can prove properties of code by algebraic substitution, exactly like a math proof. |
| **Testing** | Pure functions are trivially unit-tested: same input always yields same output. |

## 2  A First Look at Haskell

### 2.1  Running Haskell

The standard compiler is **GHC** (Glasgow Haskell Compiler). The modern way
to install it is through [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/), a toolchain
manager analogous to `rustup`:

```bash
# Install GHCup, GHC, Cabal, and Stack in one step
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```

For a quick scratchpad, use **GHCi**, the interactive REPL:

```bash
ghci
```

```
GHCi, version 9.8.2: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
ghci> 2 + 2
4
ghci> :type "hello"
"hello" :: String
```

### 2.2  Types and Type Signatures

Every Haskell expression has a type, inferred automatically by GHC. You can
annotate types explicitly with `::`:

```haskell
-- | Double an integer.
double :: Int -> Int
double n = n * 2

-- | Add two integers.
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
```

```{note}
The `->` in a type is *right-associative*, so `Int -> Int -> Int` is the
same as `Int -> (Int -> Int)`. This means `add` is a function that takes one
`Int` and returns *another function* waiting for the second `Int`.
This is called **currying** and it underlies Haskell's elegant
partial-application style.
```

You can verify types in GHCi:

```
ghci> :type double
double :: Int -> Int
ghci> :type add 3
add 3 :: Int -> Int
```

### 2.3  Pattern Matching and Recursion

Haskell encourages defining functions by *cases* using pattern matching:

```haskell
-- | Factorial, defined by pattern matching.
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

GHC checks that patterns are *exhaustive* — covering every possible input —
which prevents a whole class of runtime crashes common in other languages.

---

## 3  The Problem of Effects

Pure functions are great for reasoning, but real programs must interact
with the world: read files, accept user input, write to a database, send
network requests. These are **effects** — observable interactions with
state or the environment beyond the function's return value.

Haskell's answer is to make effects *visible in the type*. A function that
can perform I/O is given a return type wrapped in `IO`:

```haskell
-- Pure — type says nothing about the outside world
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x

-- Effectful — the IO wrapper tells the reader (and GHC) this touches the world
greet :: IO ()
greet = putStrLn "Hello, world!"
```

The type `IO ()` is read: "an I/O action that produces a value of type `()`
(unit, like `void` in C)". The type `IO String` would be an action that
produces a `String` after performing some I/O.

```{warning}
You cannot accidentally call a pure function in a way that causes I/O,
nor can you extract a value from `IO` and use it in a pure context without
acknowledging the boundary. GHC *enforces* this at compile time.
```

This boundary is the key insight: **purity is the default; effects are
opt-in, and opting in is visible in every type signature along the call
chain**.

---

## 4  Monads — Sequencing Effectful Computations

### 4.1  Motivation

Suppose you want to chain two I/O actions: first read a line of input,
then print a personalised greeting. In pure code you can just compose
functions. With `IO` values you need a way to *sequence* them —
"do this action, then, using whatever it produced, do the next action."

This sequencing pattern is captured by the `Monad` type class. The two
essential operations are:

| Operation | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `return` (or `pure`) | `a -> m a` | Wrap a pure value inside the monad. |
| `>>=` ("bind") | `m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b` | Run an action; pass its result to a function that produces the next action. |

For `IO` specifically:

```haskell
-- Manually sequenced with >>=
greetUser :: IO ()
greetUser =
  putStr "Enter your name: " >>= \_ ->
  getLine >>= \name ->
  putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
```

### 4.2  do-Notation

Writing `>>=` chains by hand gets unwieldy. Haskell provides **do-notation**
as syntactic sugar that looks like imperative code but desugars to `>>=`:

```haskell
-- Same function, written with do-notation
greetUser :: IO ()
greetUser = do
  putStr "Enter your name: "
  name <- getLine                       -- bind: extract the String from IO String
  putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
```

The `<-` arrow in do-notation corresponds exactly to the `\name ->` lambda
in the bind chain. Crucially, this is still pure Haskell — the do-block
*builds a description of a computation* that the runtime will execute.
Nothing is executed until `main` (the program entry point) runs it.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = greetUser
```

### 4.3  The Monad Laws

Every instance of `Monad` must satisfy three algebraic laws, which are
the formal basis for equational reasoning about monadic code:

```
-- Left identity:  return a >>= f   ≡   f a
-- Right identity: m >>= return     ≡   m
-- Associativity:  (m >>= f) >>= g  ≡   m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)
```

These laws guarantee that `>>=` behaves like sequential composition: you
can refactor a chain of monadic actions — extracting sub-chains into named
helpers, or inlining them — without changing the program's meaning. This
is equational reasoning applied to effectful code.

---

## 5  Verified Error Handling: `Maybe` and `Either`

One of Haskell's most practically valuable monads is `Maybe`, which
encodes *optional* values without null pointers.

### 5.1  The `Maybe` Type

```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

A value of type `Maybe Int` is either `Nothing` (absence of a value) or
`Just 42` (a present value). There is no `null` — the type itself forces
you to handle both cases.

```haskell
-- | Safe integer division: returns Nothing on divide-by-zero.
safeDiv :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
safeDiv _ 0 = Nothing
safeDiv x y = Just (x `div` y)
```

```
ghci> safeDiv 10 2
Just 5
ghci> safeDiv 10 0
Nothing
```

### 5.2  Chaining with the `Maybe` Monad

The `Maybe` monad propagates `Nothing` automatically through a chain of
computations — the monadic equivalent of short-circuit evaluation:

```haskell
-- | Look up a value, double it, then halve it — failing safely at any step.
compute :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
compute x y z = do
  a <- safeDiv x y   -- Nothing if y = 0
  b <- safeDiv a z   -- Nothing if z = 0
  return (a + b)
```

```
ghci> compute 100 5 2
Just 30
ghci> compute 100 0 2
Nothing
ghci> compute 100 5 0
Nothing
```

Without `Maybe`, each division would need its own `if` check. With the
monad, the failure plumbing is handled automatically — and, crucially,
it is *impossible* to forget. A pure `Int -> Int -> Int` function *cannot*
represent failure; you must choose a richer type.

### 5.3  `Either` for Structured Errors

`Maybe` discards the reason for failure. `Either` preserves it:

```haskell
data Either e a = Left e | Right a
```

By convention, `Left` carries an error value and `Right` carries a success
value. (Remember it as: "right is right.")

```haskell
data DivError = DivideByZero | NegativeInput deriving (Show)

safeDiv' :: Int -> Int -> Either DivError Int
safeDiv' _ 0 = Left DivideByZero
safeDiv' x y
  | x < 0 || y < 0 = Left NegativeInput
  | otherwise       = Right (x `div` y)
```

```
ghci> safeDiv' 10 2
Right 5
ghci> safeDiv' 10 0
Left DivideByZero
ghci> safeDiv' (-4) 2
Left NegativeInput
```

The `Either DivError` monad sequences these checks exactly like `Maybe`
does, but a caller receiving a `Left` always knows *why* the computation
failed — this information is encoded in the type and cannot be lost.

```{tip}
In production Haskell, libraries like
[`transformers`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers) and
[`mtl`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl) let you stack multiple
monadic effects (e.g., I/O *and* error-handling) using **monad transformer
stacks**, generalising the pattern seen with `IO`, `Maybe`, and `Either`.
```

---

## 6  Equational Reasoning in Practice

Let us verify a small property of our `safeDiv` function using equational
reasoning — the same style used in formal verification tools like
[Liquid Haskell](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/) and
[Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/).

**Claim:** `safeDiv x 1 = Just x` for all `Int` `x`.

**Proof:**

```
safeDiv x 1
  = Just (x `div` 1)    -- by the second equation of safeDiv (1 ≠ 0)
  = Just x              -- by the arithmetic law  x `div` 1 = x
```

Each step substitutes equals for equals. This works because `safeDiv` is
**pure**: there is no hidden state that could make the second call behave
differently from the first, so the substitution is always valid.

Compare this to proving a property of an imperative function that mutates
a counter — you would need to reason about the entire machine state at
every step, an exponentially harder task.

## 7  Putting It Together — A Small Complete Program

Below is a self-contained program that exercises `IO`, do-notation,
`Maybe`, and pattern matching together:

```haskell
module Main where

import Text.Read (readMaybe)

-- | Safe division, as defined earlier.
safeDiv :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
safeDiv _ 0 = Nothing
safeDiv x y = Just (x `div` y)

-- | Prompt the user for an Int, retrying on bad input.
readInt :: String -> IO Int
readInt prompt = do
  putStr prompt
  line <- getLine
  case readMaybe line of
    Just n  -> return n
    Nothing -> do
      putStrLn "Not a valid integer. Please try again."
      readInt prompt

main :: IO ()
main = do
  x <- readInt "Numerator:   "
  y <- readInt "Denominator: "
  case safeDiv x y of
    Nothing -> putStrLn "Error: division by zero."
    Just q  -> putStrLn ("Result: " ++ show q)
```

Notice the separation of concerns enforced by the type system:

- `safeDiv` is **pure** (`Maybe Int`, no `IO`) — it can be reasoned about
  and tested without any runtime.
- `readInt` is **effectful** (`IO Int`) — it interacts with the terminal.
- `main` is the single point that connects them.

This separation is not a convention — GHC will reject any attempt to call
`putStrLn` from inside `safeDiv` or to embed a pure function's result in
an `IO` context without an explicit `return`.

## 8  Modern Haskell Tooling

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|---|---|---|
| [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) | Toolchain manager (GHC, Cabal, Stack, HLS) | `curl … | sh` |
| [GHCi](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/ghci.html) | Interactive REPL, bundled with GHC | ships with GHC |
| [Cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/) | Build tool and package manager | via GHCup |
| [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) | Reproducible build tool with curated Stackage snapshots | via GHCup |
| [HLS](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/) | Haskell Language Server (IDE integration) | via GHCup |
| [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) | Central package repository | browser / Cabal |
| [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) | Search by type signature or name | browser |

```{tip}
**Hoogle** is uniquely powerful: you can search for a function by its type
signature. For example, searching `(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]` immediately
surfaces `map`. This workflow — think about what type a function should
have, then search for it — reflects how experienced Haskell programmers
navigate the ecosystem.
```

## 9  Summary

| Concept | Key Idea |
|---|---|
| **Pure function** | Output depends only on inputs; no side effects. |
| **Equational reasoning** | Pure code can be proven correct by algebraic substitution. |
| **`IO` type** | Marks effectful computations; enforced at compile time by GHC. |
| **Monad** | Abstraction for sequencing computations, especially effectful ones. |
| **do-notation** | Syntactic sugar over `>>=`; desugars to pure functional code. |
| **`Maybe` / `Either`** | Monads for safe, composable error handling without null or exceptions. |

Haskell's design forces a clear boundary between pure logic and effectful
interaction. This boundary is what makes equational reasoning — and
ultimately formal verification — tractable: the pure core of a program can
be proved correct in isolation, and the effectful shell can be kept thin
and auditable.
